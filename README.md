# Sentiment Analysis using Artificial Intelligence

## Overview
This project implements a Sentiment Analysis system that automatically classifies movie reviews as **Positive** or **Negative** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

The model is trained on the IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset and can predict sentiment for any custom user input.
